Generate the full code implementation (not just planning) for the ClearCare Compliance MVP per the spec in C:\m\MetaGPT\MVP_SPEC.md. Create repo at .\workspace\clearcare_compliance with EXACT layout, Docker/compose, Makefile('make up'), .env.example, FastAPI ingest/validate/publish/analytics, Next.js admin pages (Upload/Runs/Evidence Packs), tests (incl. 1.2GB generator), and docs. Evidence Pack must be a zip (HTML+JSON+CSV). Print the repo path when done.
