# Deployment Fix for Render

## Issue
The deployment failed with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'clearcare_compliance'
```

## Root Cause
The `clearcare_compliance` package was not being installed during deployment, but the FastAPI app was trying to import it.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
Modified `app/Dockerfile` to:
- Copy the `clearcare_compliance` package directory
- Copy `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`
- Install the package with `pip install -e .`

### 2. Added Fallback Handling
Updated `app/api.py` to:
- Try importing the package with graceful fallback
- Use existing validators if package is not available
- Print warning message when falling back

### 3. Updated Requirements
Added missing dependencies to `requirements.txt`:
- `pandas>=2.2`
- `rich>=13.7`
- `click>=8.1`
- `python-dateutil>=2.9`

### 4. Created Installation Scripts
- `build.sh` - Shell script for deployment
- `install_package.py` - Python script to install package
- `setup.py` - Package setup configuration

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)
The Dockerfile has been updated to handle the package installation automatically.

### Option 2: Direct Deployment
If deploying directly without Docker:

1. **Add build command to Render:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Or use the install script:**
   ```bash
   python install_package.py
   ```

### Option 3: Fallback Mode
The application will now work even if the package is not installed, using the existing validators as fallback.

## Verification

### Test Locally
```bash
# Test package installation
pip install -e .

# Test FastAPI import
python -c "from app.api import app; print('âœ… FastAPI app imports successfully')"

# Test CLI
clearcare-validate --help
```

### Test Deployment
The app should now start successfully and show either:
- "Package available" (if installed correctly)
- "Warning: clearcare_compliance package not available, using fallback validators" (if fallback is used)

## Files Modified

1. `app/Dockerfile` - Updated to install package
2. `app/api.py` - Added fallback handling
3. `requirements.txt` - Added missing dependencies
4. `setup.py` - Created package setup
5. `build.sh` - Created build script
6. `install_package.py` - Created install script

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy** the application to Render
2. **Check logs** for either successful package import or fallback warning
3. **Test functionality** - both new validators (if available) and fallback validators should work
4. **Monitor** for any remaining issues

The deployment should now succeed, and the application will work with either the new package validators or the existing fallback validators.
