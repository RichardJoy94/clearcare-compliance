## Programming Language

Python and JavaScript

## Original Requirements

Generate the full code implementation (not just planning) for the ClearCare Compliance MVP per the spec in C:\m\MetaGPT\MVP_SPEC.md. Create repo at .\workspace\clearcare_compliance with EXACT layout, Docker/compose, Makefile('make up'), .env.example, FastAPI ingest/validate/publish/analytics, Next.js admin pages (Upload/Runs/Evidence Packs), tests (incl. 1.2GB generator), and docs. Evidence Pack must be a zip (HTML+JSON+CSV). Print the repo path when done.

## Project Name

clearcare_compliance

## Product Goals

- Ensure compliance with regulations
- Provide a user-friendly interface for admin tasks
- Facilitate easy data ingestion and reporting

## User Stories

- As an admin, I want to upload compliance documents easily
- As a user, I want to view the status of compliance runs
- As an admin, I want to generate evidence packs in various formats
- As a user, I want to receive notifications for compliance updates
- As an admin, I want to validate data before publishing

## Competitive Analysis

- Compliance Tracker: Offers basic compliance tracking but lacks advanced reporting features
- Regulatory Compliance Suite: Comprehensive but overly complex for small teams
- EasyCompliance: User-friendly but limited in data ingestion capabilities
- ComplyPro: Good analytics but expensive for small businesses
- DocuCompliance: Focuses on document management but lacks real-time updates

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires a robust backend for data handling and a responsive frontend for user interaction. The integration of FastAPI for backend services and Next.js for the frontend is essential to meet the requirements.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement FastAPI for data ingestion and validation']
- ['P0', 'Create Next.js admin pages for managing uploads and runs']
- ['P1', 'Develop a Docker/compose setup for easy deployment']
- ['P1', 'Generate evidence packs in zip format containing HTML, JSON, and CSV']
- ['P2', 'Write comprehensive tests including a 1.2GB data generator']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a clean layout with a sidebar for navigation, a main content area for displaying information, and forms for uploading documents. The design will prioritize usability and accessibility.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on specific compliance regulations to ensure the product meets all necessary requirements.
